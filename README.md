# Housing Price Prediction

- **Objective:** Predict housing prices using a machine learning model trained on historical housing data.
- **Tools Used:** Python libraries and machine learning techniques for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

---

## Files Included

- **Housing.csv:**
  - Dataset containing historical housing data with features like location, size, price, etc.
- **housing-price-predicition.ipynb:**
  - Jupyter notebook with code for loading, preprocessing data, splitting datasets, and building predictive models.

## Features of the Project

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handles missing values.
  - Encodes categorical data.
  - Normalizes numerical features.
- **Dataset Splitting:**
  - Splits data into training and testing subsets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
- **Model Training:**
  - Implements regression models to predict housing prices based on input features.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Measures model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Dependencies

- **Python Libraries Required:**
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model building and evaluation.

## How It Works

1. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Read the CSV file (`Housing.csv`) into a DataFrame using `pandas`.
2. **Preprocess the Data:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical features.
   - Normalize numerical features.
3. **Split the Data:**
   - Use `train_test_split` to create training and testing datasets.
4. **Train the Model:**
   - Apply machine learning models to predict housing prices based on input features.
5. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Use metrics like MSE and R-squared to assess model accuracy.
