Housing Price Prediction
This project aims to predict housing prices using a machine learning model trained on historical housing data. The project utilizes Python libraries and machine learning techniques to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate predictions.

Files Included
Housing.csv: The dataset containing historical housing data with features such as location, size, price, and more.
housing-price-predicition.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook with the code for loading, preprocessing data, splitting datasets, and building predictive models.

Features of the Project
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and normalizes numerical features.
Dataset Splitting: Splits the data into training and testing subsets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
Model Training: Implements regression models to predict housing prices based on input features.
Evaluation: Measures model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.

How It Works
Load the Dataset:
Read the CSV file (Housing.csv) into a DataFrame using pandas.

Preprocess the Data:
Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical ones.

Split the Data:
Use train_test_split to create training and testing datasets.

Train the Model:
Apply machine learning models to predict housing prices based on input features.

Evaluate the Model:
Use metrics like MSE and R-squared to assess model accuracy.

Outputs
Predicted housing prices for the test dataset.
Metrics evaluating the modelâ€™s performance.
Visualizations to analyze feature importance and predictions.
